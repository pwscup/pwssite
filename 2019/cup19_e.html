      <h2>About PWS Cup 2019</h2>
      <p>
        In this contest, you are to anonymize traces (i.e., movement history data that is a set of location data) while balancing the utility and privacy of the anonymized traces.
      </p>
      <div align="center">

      </div>
      <p>
        There are two phases in the contest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the data anonymizing phase, you are to anonymize traces so as to make the traces resistant to ID disclosure attack (i.e., re-identification of the original user) and trace inference attack (i.e., restoring the original location data). You also need to try to preserve the characteristics of the original traces as much as you can when you anonymize them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the ID disclosure & trace inference phase, you are to assess anonymized traces submitted by other participants. You are expected to assess the privacy level of the anonymized traces by attempting to re-identify the original users and to restore the original location data in the traces.

Below I provide my comments on the results of the preliminary round. I hope it would be helpful for you in the final round.

<p>(1) The submitted file (inferred original trace set) of the best risk assessor (trace inference) in the preliminary round was the same as the reference trace set. In other words, the team sent the reference trace set as an inferred original trace set *without* seeing the public anonymized set. We refer to this attack as a "reference trace replay attack." Some teams adopted the reference trace replay attack or its variant.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that many teams might feel that this attack made the contest uninteresting. However, we will give scores of the preliminary round for the above teams according to the rule. </p>

<p>In the preliminary round, the reference trace replay attack was very powerful, because the length of the reference and original trace sets was too short and the accuracy of the ID disclosure was low for most teams. Taking this into account, we will increase the length of the reference and original traces in the final round. </p>

<p>(2) It is also important to note that the sample program T3 was the most powerful for the anonymized traces (by the committee) in the preliminary round. This was because the accuracy of the ID disclosure was high for the anonymized traces. For such traces, a trace inference method that first re-identifies the anonymized traces and then infers the original traces can outperform the reference trace replay attack. </p>

<p>(3) My comments on the preliminary round are given in (1) and (2). However, in the final round, the length of the reference and original trace sets will be 20 days, respectively, and hence I anticipate that different strategies can be effective for anonymization, ID disclosure, and trace inference. We also performed some experiments for the 20-days long trace sets using the sample programs (see Section 4 of https://www.iwsec.org/pws/2019/cup19-sample-e.pdf). This might be helpful in the final round. </p>
