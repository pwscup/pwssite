    <h2>About iPWS Cup 2024</h2>

    <h3>Story</h3>

    <p>Company A wants to develop a movie recommendation system
    using customer data. The company decides to anonymize customer
    data for a competition to develop a recommendation system and
    make it available to the participants of the competition.
    However, even with the intention of anonymizing the data, there
    have been cases of personal identification and privacy breaches
    due to matching with external data. More recently, there has
    also been the problem of "database reconstruction attacks",
    where even anonymized data can be combined with supposedly
    secure statistical data to reconstruct the original data. Can
    Company A create highly useful anonymized data while preventing
    personal identification attacks and database reconstruction
    attacks?</p>

    <h3>Competition Overview</h3>

    <p>Each participating team takes on the roles of both
    anonymizer and attacker, competing in data anonymizing
    techniques and attacks on the anonymized data. In the data
    anonymization phase, each team takes the role of a company that
    wants to publish customer data and aims to protect the privacy
    of the people in the data by anonymizing the given data. In the
    attack phase, each team becomes an attacker who wants to
    discover the contents of the data and aims to discover more
    secret information about the individual contained in the data
    anonymized by other teams.</p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <p>The competition consists of two phases.</p>

    <p><strong>Anonymization Phase:</strong> Each team will produce
    a set of anonymized data from fictitious data on movie ratings
    (each anonymized data will be processed from original
    multi-attribute data, from which only the attributes necessary
    for analysis will be extracted). The anonymized data must be
    processed in a way that makes it difficult for others to
    identify the original information, with as little loss of
    utility as possible.</p>

    <p><strong>Attack Phase:</strong> Each team restores the values
    of the original data, some of which have been redacted by the
    other team, using anonymized data (database reconstruction
    attack). They also try to identify individuals by linking the
    original data, from which names etc. have been removed, to
    their names etc. using anonymized data.</p>

    <p>After these have been performed in turn, the results of each
    team's anonymization and attacks will be evaluated by the
    organizer. The anonymization is evaluated in terms of the
    closeness of the analysis results obtained from the anonymized
    and original data (the closer, the better) and the difficulty
    of correctly guessing the secret data of the other team (the
    more difficult, the better), while the attack is evaluated in
    terms of the accuracy of the guesses made by the other team on
    the anonymized data (the more accurate, the better).</p>
